# Autonomous VIO based Quadcopter
Implemented a planning and control stack to track trajectories in a simulation environment along with state estimation to estimate the state of the robot through an obstacle filled environment.
Performance was measured in terms of in-simulation flight time from start to goal. 

## Usage:
The util directory contains a few maps that you can use for testing your planner, controller and
estimator.



## Performance:
