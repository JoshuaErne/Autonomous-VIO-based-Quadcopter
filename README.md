# Autonomous VIO based Quadcopter
<p>Implemented a planning and control stack to track trajectories in a simulation environment along with state estimation to estimate the state of the robot through an obstacle filled environment.</p>
<p>Performance was measured in terms of in-simulation flight time from start to goal. </p>

## Usage:
<p>The util directory contains a few maps that you can use for testing your planner, controller and
estimator. </p>
